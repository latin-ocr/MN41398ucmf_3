Nona-As regards syr-pers Ι am not suggesting that the Persian
version was'translated or composed from the Syriae of syr sin or syr
cu, sor, apart from the things in common throughout, inseparable
nom the related genius of the two langnages, it is clear that pers was Ἴ
not copied from either the Old Syriae or Peshitta as we know them.

But there are points in common, which, in my‘opinion, ean 'only
have occurrednom the pers being set up from an aher Syriae still,nr,
a Graeco-Syriae, the very one, instet, which other studies lead me to
believe lays at the roots of syr sin and syr cu.

Therefore‚ where syr sin or syr cu are missing, pers is avaluable
adjunct, and to be called in to settle or thron light on disputed
points in these lacunae.
