INTRODUCTION.

Tun MS. η is far too important to have any ambiguity overlie any
ol its readings. I¹ have already called attention to some ol its
neglected lections in my book “Cancerut'ug tlae'Geaeais ιι] tlte

and it must be admitted that the results are deplorable. A good Ἴ
collator or copyist should ntake but half a dozen errors within these
